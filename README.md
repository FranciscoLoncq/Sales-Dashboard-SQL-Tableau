# Sales-Dashboard-SQL-Tableau

## Overview
This project revolves around transforming data to curate a table that will allow us to create an executive sales dashboard tailored to the sales team's needs. Data for this project has been obtained from a fictional bike store retailer that owns several stores accross the USA [Bike Stores](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ESMiCguVJjUzjVNxLffngDrHsQcMFHrt/edit#gid=1194135803) 

## Analysis
Employing SQL joins and aggregations, the resulting table encompasses crucial attributesâ€”order details, customer information, revenue metrics, product specifics, and sales team details. The cohesive integration of data from various tables ensures an overall view of sales operations. This refined table serves as the cornerstone for a dynamic and insightful executive sales dashboard that provides the sales team with data that can inform strategic decisions and drive action-oriented insights. 
Given my current role as a wholesale analyst, which involves presenting similar dashboards to the sales team, this project holds particular relevance. The project underscores the optimization of data attributes to enhance usability, creating a valuable resource for the sales team's day-to-day activities.
